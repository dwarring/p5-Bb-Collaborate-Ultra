Revision history for Bb-Collaborate-Ultra

0.01.02 27th February 2017

        Rename methods:
	  -- $session->enrollments => $session->get_enrolments
	  -- $session->logs        => $session->get_logs
	  -- $log->attendee        => $log->get_attendees
	This makes 'get' calls more explicit, and avoids occlusion
	of the 'attendee' attribute.

        Support the $session->get_logs({expand => 'all'}) query option.
	This instructs the sever to attendees as part of the session log
	(instance) records and obviates the need to then call 'get_attendees'
	on each session instance.

        Remove extraneous class:
	    --  Bb::Collaborate::Ultra::Log::Attendees

        Unbreak on Perl 5.8.9
