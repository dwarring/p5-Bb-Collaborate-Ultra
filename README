DESCRIPTION
===========
This Perl 5 module provides bindings to the the Collaborate (*) Services RESTful API. These support the CRUD and processing operations for the scheduling and access to HTML sessions.

(*) Blackboard Collaborate Ultra is a virtual classroom web service based on the WebRTC (Real Time Chat) protocol.

Resources and Schemas
---------------------
These services are described in https://xx-csa.bbcollab.com/documentation.

Each resource class and schema is represented by a Perl 5 class:

- Context - Bb::Collaborate::Ultra::Context
- Session - Bb::Collaborate::Ultra::Session
- Recording - Bb::Collaborate::Ultra::Recording

Authentication
--------------
This is managed by the Bb::Collaborate::Ultra::Connection class

Authentication is via the OAuth 2.0 protocol, using the JWT Token Flow, as described in the documentation.

INSTALLATION
============
To install this module, run the following commands:

    perl Makefile.PL
    make
    make test
    make install

Live Testing
------------
The tests in this distribution may be run against a live server by setting
up the environment variables, as shown below:

    perl Makefile.PL
    make
    export BBC_ULTRA_HOST=https://xx-csa.bbcollab.com; # for example
    export BBC_ULTRA_ISSUER=some-client-id;
    export BBC_ULTRA_SECRET=some-secret-key;
    make test

It is recommended that tests are only run on a designated test server, not a live production site.

BUGS AND LIMITATIONS
====================
- This module does not yet fully implement resource types: Users, Enrollments or Courses
- JWT Username-Password authentication is not yet supported.
