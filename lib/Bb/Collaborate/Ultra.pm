=head1 BACKGROUND

Blackboard Collaborate Ultra is software for virtual web classrooms. It is
suitable for meetings, demonstrations web conferences, seminars, general
training and support.

Bb-Ultra is a set of Perl bindings and entity definitions for the
Collaborate REST services. These can be used to administer classrooms,
including sessions, users and recordings.

=head1 DESCRIPTION

This Perl 5 module provides bindings to the the Collaborate (*) Services RESTful API. These support the CRUD and processing operations for the scheduling and access to HTML sessions.

These services are described in L<https://xx-csa.bbcollab.com/documentation>.

=head2 Resource Classes


Each resource class and schema is represented by a Perl 5 class:

=over 4

=item Context - L<Bb::Collaborate::Ultra::Context> (see L<Context Documentation|https://xx-csa.bbcollab.com/documentation#Context>)

=item Session - L<Bb::Collaborate::Ultra::Session> (see L<Session Documentation|https://xx-csa.bbcollab.com/documentation#Session>)

=item Recording - L<Bb::Collaborate::Ultra::Recording> (see L<Recording Documentation|https://xx-csa.bbcollab.com/documentation#Recording>)

=back

=head2 RESTful Services

The above classes are based on Bb::Collaborate::Ultra::DAO, which  provides low level `post`, `get`, `patch` and `del` methods. Where:

=over 4

=item `post` creates new entities on the server

=item `get` is used to fetched entities, by `id` or various other criteria

=item `patch` is used to update entities

=item `del` is used to delete items

=back

=head2 Data Mapping

Some conversion is needed between JSON and Perl:

=over 4

=item - Boolean `true` and `false` are converted to 0 and 1

=item - JSON date strings are converted to Unix numeric timestamps, rounded to the nearest second. For example, `2016-12-15T22:26:17.000Z` is converted to 1481840777.

=back

These conversions are applied on data being sent or received from the Collaborate Ultra server.

=head2 Authentication

Authentication is via the OAuth 2.0 protocol, using the JWT Token Flow, as described in the L<documentation|https://xx-csa.bbcollab.com/documentation>.

See L<Bb::Collaborate::Ultra::Connection> for details.

=head1 BUGS AND LIMITATIONS

=over 4

=item - This module does not yet fully implement resource types: Users, Enrollments or Courses

=item - JWT Username-Password authentication is not yet supported.
